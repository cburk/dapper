LDAP Enumeration Tool

Created as a learning exercise and for use in the OSCP exam.

Specifically intended to automate some common pre-auth enumeration queries that would be tedious to perform manually, and to help process the output of those queries.

My intention is to keep this tool light weight and compartmentalized.  This should allow newcomers to modify the tool to suit their particular needs and read the code to learn some basic ldap concepts.

Built for and tested on Kali Linux.
